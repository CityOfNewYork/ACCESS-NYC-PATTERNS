#### Global Script

The Text Controller Object requires JavaScript for showing and hiding the text control options and for resizing the page's text size. It uses a Cookie to store the user's preferred text size. To use the Text Controller Object through the global ACCESS NYC Patterns script use the following code:

    <!-- Global Script -->
    <script src="dist/scripts/AccessNyc.js"></script>

    <script>
      var access = new AccessNyc();
      access.textController();
    </script>

This will instantiate the Text Controller Object and attach event listeners for toggling the options and text resize controls.

#### Module Import

The ES6 and IFFE modules all require importing and object instantiation in your main script. You must pass a dom selection of the Text Controller Object to the instantiated class. A selector reference is stored in the class.

    // ES6
    import TextController from 'src/objects/text-controller/text-controller';

    <!-- IFFE -->
    <script src="dist/objects/text-controller/text-controller.iffe.js"></script>

    let element = document.querySelector(TextController.selector);
    new TextController(element);

#### Dependencies and Polyfills

This script uses the [Toggle Utility](/toggle) as a dependency and reqiures the same polyfills for IE11 support. See the ["Toggle Usage" section](/toggle#toggle-usage) for details on specific methods. Additionally, it uses [JavaScript Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) as a dependency.
