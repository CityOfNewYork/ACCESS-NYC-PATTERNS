The Text Controller Component contains two elements: a language menu and a text sizer. When JavaScript is enabled, it has two primary states: expanded language options and collapsed language options. All language options are visible at page landing, but for all page visits afterwords, it collapses and gives the option of expanding to show the language options menu again. The current language switcher on [ACCESS NYC](https://access.nyc.gov) is displayed through the [WordPress Multilingual Plugin (WPML)](https://wpml.org/).
