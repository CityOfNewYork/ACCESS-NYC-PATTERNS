The Newsletter Object is an embedded Mailchimp signup form. More details about embedded Mailchimp forms can be found on the [Mailchimp website](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/). This form can work with any Mailchimp subscriber list that is configured through the form action;

     form action="https://nyc.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=d04b7b607bddbd338b416fa89&id=98ff3f3900" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form"

While the Newsletter Object doesn't require JavaScript, it is needed for borough data processing (Which borough(s) would you like to recieve updates for?) and front-end validation.
