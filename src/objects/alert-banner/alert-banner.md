The Alert Banner Object contains messages and information relevant to users. When JavaScript is enabled the alert is visible at page landing allowing a user the option to close it. When a user closes the banner, it will be hidden for all page visits afterwards unless there is a new message or the alert's cookie has expired or cleared.
