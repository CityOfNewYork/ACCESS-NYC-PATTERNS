The base button class is extended with either `.btn-primary` or `.btn-secondary`. Any button type can be extended by the the primary or secondary class.

For the most part, buttons should be marked up with the `<button>` tag for screen readers. If a button has link functionality, however, the `role` attribute can be set to `button`. This documentation displays both markup types for reference.

There are 2 primary conventions for Button Elements:

* Buttons associated with functionality (Primary)
* Buttons that navigate users through a set of pages, such as through the program pages (Secondary)
