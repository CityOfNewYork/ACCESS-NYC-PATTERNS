The Autocomplete Input Element uses JavaScript to provide an accessibile and selectable list of suggested terms as a user types into the field. The suggested terms are passed to the `InputAutocomplete` class on instantiation and can be updated on the fly with new terms. Terms are displayed in order by relevance and synonym mapping (see usage details below), Additionally, the function is miss-spelling tolerant.

Accessibility is suppported through aria attributes that will prompt the user on how to use the dropdown list. Screen readers will also announce the list of options in the dropdown as the user navigates them with the keyboard.
