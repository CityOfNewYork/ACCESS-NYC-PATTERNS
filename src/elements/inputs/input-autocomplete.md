The Autocomplete Input Element uses JavaScript to provide a selectable list of suggested terms as a user types into the field. The suggested terms are passed to the `InputAutocomplete` class on instantiation and can be updated on the fly with new terms. Terms are displayed in order by relevance and synonym mapping (see usage details below), Additionally, the function is miss-spelling tolerant.
