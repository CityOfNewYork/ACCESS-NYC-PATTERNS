ACCESS NYC uses [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to support the Patterns in multiple languages. It includes sans-serif and serif variations for over 800 languages and is designed to appear equal in weight and size across languages. This makes the multilingual templates easier to develop and non-English content easier to read.
