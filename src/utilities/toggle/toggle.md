The toggle utility uses JavaScript to show and hide elements based on user interaction. This will toggle dynamic aria attributes as well as dynamic classes on both the toggling element and toggle target. "hidden" will be toggled on the target element and the class "active" will be toggled on the toggling element and target element. The basic toggle uses the static `aria-controls` attribute to select the target element by its `id`.

The use of `aria-expanded` on the toggling element is recommended for toggling elements as it will announce that the target of the toggle is "expanded" or "collapsed." Additional dynamic attributes will only be toggled if they are present on the target element when the page loads. Other aria attributes and roles can be used in combination with the toggling elements to create different interactions with custom components. [View the usage section](#toggle-usage) to get an idea of what the different options are.

The Toggle Utility supports having more than one toggle element per toggle target (the "Menu" and "Close Menu" links of this site are an example).
