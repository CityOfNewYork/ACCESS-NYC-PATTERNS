The ACCESS NYC Patterns use [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to support the Patterns in multiple languages. It includes sans-serif and serif variations for over 800 languages and is designed to appear equal in weight and size across languages. This makes the multilingual templates easier to develop and non-English content easier to read. Using the `.font-serif` or `.font-sans` utility will render the serif or san-serif font of the current language selected.
