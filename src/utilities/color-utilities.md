With the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors#customizing) every color in ACCESS NYC Patterns can be used as a utility class for static, hover, and responsive states of the [text](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color), [border](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color), and [background](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color) properties. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for full details. In order to maintain WCAG AA compliance, custom combinations of text and background colors must be tested for adequate contrast. The [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) makes testing easy.

Below are examples of the color utilities and their corresponding selectors. Please note, not all of the text color examples are accessible because they show the color utility in use on a white background.
