With the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors#customizing)
every color in ACCESS NYC Patterns can be used as a utility class for static, hover,
and responsive states of the [text](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color),
[border](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color), and [background](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color),
properties. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for
full details. In order to maintain WCAG AA compliance, custom combinations of text
and background colors must be tested for adequate contrast. This can be done easily
with the [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
