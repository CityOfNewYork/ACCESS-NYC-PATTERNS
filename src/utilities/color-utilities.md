With the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors#customizing)
every color in ACCESS NYC Patterns can be used as a utility class for static, hover,
and responsive states of the [text](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color),
[border](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color), and [background](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color),
properties. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for
full details. In order to maintain WCAG AA compliance, custom combinations of text
and background colors must be tested for adequate contrast. This can be done easily
with the [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

Below are are examples of the color utilities in use and their corresponding
selectors. Please note, not all of the text color examples are accessible because
they are examples of the color utility in use on a white background.
