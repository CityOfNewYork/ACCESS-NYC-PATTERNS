The ACCESS NYC Patterns color palette builds on top of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/colors/).
Specific combinations were tested for adequate contrast following the distinguishable
guideline of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

Body text color is black on white and heading text color is dark blue, meeting
compliance and utilizing brand colors of ACCESS NYC. Because we cannot rely on
illustrating all interactive elements purely by color, hyperlinks are also underlined
to accommodate color blindness.

Primary and a secondary colors highlight interactions with buttons and hyperlinks.
Each state of interaction, including default, hover, and focus states, conform
to the WCAG AA standard at a base level.
