The ACCESS NYC Patterns are available for [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) to create new interfaces and build prototypes. Design files are generated from the source code by [HTML Sketch App](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp). We are working to create complete designs with all UI Elements to address the current limitations on HTML Sketch App exports. Limitations include missing pseudo elements and bullets in lists.

## Whatâ€™s Included

### Sketch File

A Sketch file with all of the Patterns exported as reusable symbols. It also includes colors, icons, and text styles.

### Font Files

Fonts need to be installed on your computer for the Patterns to render properly. They are included in the download.

### Icon SVGs

All of the ACCESS NYC icons are included as individual SVG files.
