The ACCESS NYC Patterns are available for [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) to create new interfaces and build prototypes. Design files are generated from the source code by HTML Sketch App. There are currently some limitations with what [HTML Sketch App](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp) can export so we are working through creating complete designs with all UI Elements. Limitations include missing pseudo elements and bullets in lists.

## Whatâ€™s Included

### Sketch File
A Sketch file with all of the Patterns exported as reusable symbols. It also includes colors, icons, and text styles.

### Font Files
