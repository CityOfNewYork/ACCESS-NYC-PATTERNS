There are a few options when integrating the patterns, but using NPM Install is recommended.

    $ npm install @nycopportunity/access-patterns

### Download

Optionally, you may [download an archive](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS/archive/master.zip) of this repository to include in your project.

### CDN

You can pick which files in the [distribution folder of the repository](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS/tree/v0.1.0/dist) to use by linking to them through [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com). For example, the link of the v0.1.0 default stylesheet:

    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cityofnewyork/access-nyc-patterns@v0.1.0/dist/styles/site-default.css

You can include this link in the `<head>` of your html document.

    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cityofnewyork/access-nyc-patterns@v0.1.0/dist/styles/site-default.css" rel="stylesheet">

You can learn more about the different ways to use JsDelivr on itâ€™s [feature page](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features). All Components and Objects are also distributed with their own styles and JavaScript dependencies in their corresponding  **/dist** folder. For example, all of the accordion dependencies live in the **/dist/components/accordion** folder.

Keep in mind, there are regular releases to the patterns which follow semantic versioning. You can follow the [new releases on the repository releases page](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS/releases).
