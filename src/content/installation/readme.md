The ACCESS NYC Patterns are built using the [NYCO Patterns Framework](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyco-patterns-framework); a front-end stack, CLI, and cross-utility library for design systems. These installation instructions are automatically generated by the framework. For more details about the framework visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyco-patterns-framework).
