The Accordion Component is a set of content with a header. With JavaScript enabled, the Accordion Component will toggle open or closed. Without JavaScript enabled and within print views, it will remain open. The script adds the appropriate ARIA attributes to the accordion content based on whether the component is visible or hidden.

When implementing a set of accordions stacked on top of each other, the first accordion should be open when the user lands on the page. Opening one accordion does not automatically close the other accordions.
