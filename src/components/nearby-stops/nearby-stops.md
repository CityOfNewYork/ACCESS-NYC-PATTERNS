The Nearby Stops Component will parse a list of MTA subway transit data from the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49) and use a single latitude and longitude to locate the nearest stop. Note: it will not fetch the data directly but will retrieve it from a local endpoint.
