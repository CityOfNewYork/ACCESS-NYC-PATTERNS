The Filter Component is a list of categories used to get more granular results in a search. With JavaScript enabled, the Filter Component will toggle open or closed. The markup for the list can be a navigation `<nav>` element with hyperlinks or standard unordered list `<ul>` element with hyperlinks `<a>` or buttons `<buttons>` as the filtering element. Hyperlinks would be used for filters that navigate to different pages and buttons would trigger in-page functionality. Below is an example of a filter using a navigation element with hyperlinks.
