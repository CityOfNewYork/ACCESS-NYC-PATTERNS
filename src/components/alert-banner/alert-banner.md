The Alert Banner contains messages and information relevant to users. Whether
the Alert Banner is visible  depends on the Cookie JavaScript Utility and a
user's interaction. When a user lands on a page, the alert's cookie will be
checked or created. When a user closes the Alert Banner, the cookie will get an
expiration date, allowing the user to navigate the site without seeing the alert
until the expiration date has passed.
This alert component consist of icons and a block containing the banner's
message. [Click here to see a full page demonstration](demos/alert-banner).
