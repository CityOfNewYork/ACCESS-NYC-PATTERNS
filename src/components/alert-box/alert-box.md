Alert Box Components contain relevant messages for the user in the form of information, success, urgent, and warnings. The Alert Box Component is based on the Alerts Pattern in the [U.S. Web Design System](https://standards.usa.gov/alerts/). The primary uses for alerts on the site are to indicate a successful screening or warn that other city applications will not work on mobile devices.
