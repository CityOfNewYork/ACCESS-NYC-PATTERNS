The Text Controller Component contains two elements: a language menu and a text sizer. When JavaScript is enabled, it has two primary states: expanded language options and collapsed language options. All language options are visible at page landing, but for all page visits afterwords, it collapses and gives the option of expanding to show the language options menu again.

Note that the language the site is currently in (in the case below, English) is not displayed. If the site is switched to a different language, that language is removed from the list and the alternative languages are listed.
