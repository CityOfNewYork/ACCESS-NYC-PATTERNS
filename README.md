# ACCESS NYC Pattern Library (pre-release)

This project is under active development by the Product and Design team at
[NYC Opportunity](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfNewYork/teams/nycopportunity). We are currently in the process of migrating styles into this repository and setting up templates for documentation.

NYC Opportunity is the [New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity](http://nyc.gov/opportunity). We are committed to sharing open source software that we use in our products. Feel free to ask questions and share feedback.

# Conversations and Development

## 3/4/18 - NYC School of Data Presentation

Talk about the development of the ACCESS NYC Design System and ACCESS NYC PEU experience at the NYC School of Data: https//youtu.be/bfPOgJex5T4?t=6h48m42s

## 1/9/18 - Overview of the ACCESS NYC PATTERNS static site application and the organization of the stylesheets

We discussed the structure of the static site generator for ACCESS NYC PATTERNS which was based on all of the initial work behind the NYCO Patterns repository. It’s gone under a pretty big overhaul in terms of organization. We also discussed the stylesheet organization of stylesheets and integrating ACCESS NYC. Specifically, we discussed the organization of components, objects, elements, and default styles.

We also discussed the different users of this library. While it’s mainly for internal usage, we can make it easy for others to adopt or use as a reference. Future builds can offer a more interactive experience, where users can modify and render changes before they use the package.

## 12/5/17 - Common Language Follow-Up 12/05/17

### Summary

This is a follow-up to the Common Language activity. From the votes and suggestions, we will create groupings of objects and their nested components and elements. 

### Notes

Final names were chosen for components. In order to clarify some of the names, we grouped or consolidated components that were essentially the same, but assigned types to them.

### Follow Up

With a common language decided on for components we can move forward with adjusting and documenting the stylesheet for reusability. We have a couple of ideas for the next excercise

#### Exercise 1

Start to port over styles from ACCESS-NYC to the ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS and use the nyco-patterns boilerplate as a starter. Create something to get the team excited about.

#### Exercise 2

Variable naming exercise. Print out (or code up) the unique variables for ACCESS-NYC. Allow people to comment on and name them.

#### Exercise 3

Mapping exercise. Illustrate the elements that make up each object in our patterns. Look for ways to name the nested components within them.

#### Exercise 4

We have an Invision project that includes screenshots of some pattern libraries. On it we have commented on some of the things we like from them with the idea that we would use elements from them to build our components.

We think we can include the rest of the team to add screens and get their comments on it.

## 11/28/17 - ACCESS NYC Naming Exercise

### Summary

ACCESS NYC and Growing Up NYC utilize modern front-end build systems and naming conventions to manage their front-end components. There are ways we can improve them to make them easier to manage, more scalable, portable, and sharable within our team and across products.  

The long goal is to create common libraries and a process that we can use to share as a team to continue to improve the products we develop or help deliver.  

The first step we’ve decided to take is to perform a small audit of ACCESS NYC patterns, organize them with a modern convention (SUIT CSS, a reliable and testable styling methodology for component-based UI development), and pick names for components that make sense to our team so that we start to develop a common language for components. The hope is that developing a common language will enable us to focus on the users we are serve.  

We will then take these names and apply them in the code and use them to document the components in a static pattern site for ACCESS NYC (modeled after the tooling used to create the NYCO Patterns Github, Public Site).  

How to; there is a board with several components isolated and post-its with current names next to them. Write in a suggested name for the component or vote for another name you like.  

If you can’t make it the board will be pinned up in the design room or hallway.

### Notes

Everyone submitted names for most of the components and elements after everything was organized into Elements, Components, Objects. For the next Tech Tuesday we decided to try grouping components and picking the final names after tallying votes.

## 10/31/17 - Patterns Library Walkthrough and New Repos

- Brief walkthrough of the nyco-patterns repository [https://cityofnewyork.github.io/nyco-patterns](https://cityofnewyork.github.io/nyco-patterns)

- Identifying components on Access pages

- We will create a separate patterns repository for each project:

- - ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS

- - growingupnyc-patterns

- - servicedesign-patterns

## 10/17/17 - Design Systems and Future Trainings

Recapping from the Technical Tuesday #3

- Building a design system where we really consider the main functions of the application and break them down into modules

- What are the design tools we’ll be using in the future?

- Github training to keep everyone aware of updates

- Referencing existing design documents

- Using the nyco-patterns as a starter to build common language

## 9/26/17 - Production Readiness and Design Handoffs

It would be easier to have all the designs in one place that can be tracked. We propose the setup of a github repository where the designers can upload Sketch files, links, and other assets

- Why? Can act as the final resting place for designs that can be accessed by everyone.

- Include slack integration so changes can be seen easily. Version control also allows to go back and forth

- We can provide training

## 9/19/17 - Patterns, Assets

Patterns and Asset Management Discussion Notes

Potential Action Items;

- Establishing a common language for our the whole team

- Audit current components in products

- Illustrate use of patterns with previous project case study

- Discuss the PEU case study in regard to overlapping design/tech

- Test out establishing patterns system with upcoming service design projects

Here is the current patterns repository;
https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyco-patterns

And the development Slack Channel for it;

## 9/12/17 - Assets, Vendor Docs

Create assets library and styleguide for all projects

Purpose: For everyone to have the latest assets to-date and so that we can package for external agencies working on or with our products

- What does this look like?

- Project-specific?

- Github repo?

- Github training for all!

- Is there a product out there that does this?

- How can we all access these assets seamlessly?

- What about Lingo?

Creating consistency especially when working with vendors

- It seems that communication from our team to vendor gets re-translated to external developers. 

- How can we create standards and naming conventions for enhancements in the future.

- Complete package.json files

- Might be better to have the backend team send us the js files that we can bundle ourselves to limit build errors
