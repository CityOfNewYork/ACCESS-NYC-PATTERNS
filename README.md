# ACCESS NYC Patterns

The [Patterns of ACCESS NYC](https://cityofnewyork.github.io/ACCESS-NYC-PATTERNS/) are a shared vocabulary between the code, design, and user interface (UI) of [ACCESS NYC](https://access.nyc.gov) created for the Mayorâ€™s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) Service Design Studio and Product Teams. ACCESS NYC aims to increase the accessibility and convenience of discovering and enrolling in government benefits. The Patterns support this work by defining the UI and behavior that New Yorkers experience as they use the site.
