The ACCESS NYC Patterns color palette builds on top of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/colors/). Specific combinations were tested for adequate contrast following the distinguishability guideline of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

Body text color is black on white and heading text color is dark blue, meeting compliance and using the brand colors of ACCESS NYC. Because we canâ€™t illustrate all interactive elements solely  with color, hyperlinks are also underlined to accommodate color blindness.

Primary and secondary colors highlight interactions with buttons and hyperlinks. Each state of interaction, including default, hover, and focus states, conform to the WCAG AA standard at a base level.

Below are swatches with examples of the approved color combinations. Please note that WCAG AA compliance  depends on the base text size. The examples below may not be fully compliant because their font-size is set to a smaller size.
