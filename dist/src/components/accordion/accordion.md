The Accordion Component is a block of content with a header. With JavaScript enabled, the Accordion Component will toggle open or closed using the [Toggle JavaScript Utility](/toggle). All of the same accessible attribute toggling functionality the [Toggle Utility](/toggle) provides will apply (`aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-hidden`). Without JavaScript enabled or within print views, it will remain open.

When implementing a set of accordions stacked on top of each other, the first accordion should be open when the user lands on the page. Additionally, opening one accordion does not automatically close the other accordions.
